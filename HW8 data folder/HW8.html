<h1>Homework 8: Census Data Ratios and Categories   </h1>
<h2>Joseph Hernandez</h2>
<h3>My ratio was the # of Bachelor Degrees/ Total Population of each county in Texas. I created this data because the data I previously used was a percentage so it was not going to work as a ratio. I also created this ratio because I am currently attempting to get my Bachelors degree and I believe it is important for people to get an education and this allows us to see how many people in Texas receieved an education up to a Bachelors degreee. </h3>

<h3>Pros: -Good for mapping values that are not evenly distrubted  
    Cons: -Class ranges suited for one data set
-Difficult to compare with other data sets  </h3>
