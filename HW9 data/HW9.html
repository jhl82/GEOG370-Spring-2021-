<h1>Homework 9 Choropleth Map: COVID Cases in NC  </h1>
<h2>Joseph Hernandez</h2>
<h3> My map displays the number of COVID cases in each county of North Carolina. I chose to create this map because I am from NC and I thought it would be interesting to see the distribution of COVID cases throughout the State in order to see which counties are being impacted the most by the virus. I also chose to create this map because I believe it is important for us to see how COVID is impacting the areas around us and how it is still something that we must take seriously. This map allows us to see that there are still plenty of COVID cases around us and we must continue to take precautions in order to slow the spread of the virus. If we continue to take the proper precautions, we could possibly all be able to come back to campus and have face to face classes again. </h3>
