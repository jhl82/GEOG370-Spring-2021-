<h3>This map of Texas represents the labor force participation rate in Texas for individuals who are 16 and older during 2019. The labor force participation rate is a measure of the number of working age individuals who are employed or are actively seeking employment. This figure can sometimes be misleading as it does not account for people who are capable of working but have stopped searching for employment for whatever reason. </h3>
